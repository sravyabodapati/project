<p>I am currently attending Dublin High School and will be graduating in June of 2020. I have basic knowledge of a few code languages and will be extending my knowledge in the future. I am also taking a Computer Science Principles class this year. I have a black belt in Kuk Sool Won martial arts as well as many awards. My top five work skills are:
  <ul>
<li>Passion to learn</li>
<li>Strong team player</li>
<li>Focused and efficient</li>
<li>Can easily build rapport</li>
<li>Persistent</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
After graduating from Dublin High School, I plan to attend San Jose State University and major in Computer Science. After getting my Bachelor’s degree, I want to continue to get my Master’s degree in Computer Science. After this, I hope to become a web developer. My hobbies include photography, playing the keyboard, and coding. I love photography and playing the keyboard, and coding is something I hope to pursue and get better at.

I had a summer job at a childcare center called Safari Kid a few years ago, which was my first job and work experience. I also lead classes at my martial arts school, so I pride myself in being able to work well with both kids and adults. I have gotten multiple Integrity in Action awards, school-wide and district-wide. I also have seven martial arts medals as well as a trophy . I am currently working at a tutoring center called Eyelevel.
